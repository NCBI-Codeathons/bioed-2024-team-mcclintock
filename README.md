# Project Summary
We are intending to develop an activity that compares sturctural and molecular differences between a herbicide resistant and a herbicide suseptible weed (or Arabidopsis).  The students will figure out which protein is affected, what the sequence difference is between the resistant and suseptible varieties, and what the protein differences look like.  Then the students will suggest an alternative herbicide that uses a different pathway to kill the resistand weed.

This activity targets an introductory college audience - Introduction to Biology.  It uses BLAST and protein databases.

Briefly describe the developed curriculum package. Include the target audience (e.g., high school biology students) and highlight the NCBI resources used.

# Curricular Package Details

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.
