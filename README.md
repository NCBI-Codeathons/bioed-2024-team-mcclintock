# Project Summary
Briefly describe the developed curriculum package. Include the target audience (e.g., high school biology students) and highlight the NCBI resources used.

We are intending to develop an activity that compares sturctural and molecular differences between a herbicide resistant and a herbicide sensitive weed (or Arabidopsis).  The students will figure out which protein is affected, what the sequence difference is between the resistant and sensitive varieties, and what the protein differences look like.  Then the students will suggest an alternative herbicide that uses a different pathway to kill the resistand weed.

This activity targets an introductory college audience - Introduction to Biology.  It uses BLAST and protein databases.


# Curricular Package Details


## Learning Objectives
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.

- Successfully utilize NCBI databases and software: BLAST, icN3D, PubMed, COBALT; and other software: Expasy
- Understand transcription, translation, and codon table
- Predict what effect a mutation will have on protein activity
- Understand mutatations: missense, frameshift, nonsense
- Use computer tools to model the protein structure
- Understand general mechanisms of herbicides
- Understand the role of selective pressures on evolution of organisms

## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.

# NCBI Codeathon Disclaimer
This poject was created as part of the BioEd Summit Curricula-thon, a week-long event focused on collaborative development of data-driven learning experiences. While we encourage you to explore and adapt this project, please be aware that NCBI does not provide ongoing support for it.
