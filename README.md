# Target Audience
This activity targets an introductory biology college audience. It can be modified for upper level classes as well.  As written it would be appropriate for Introduction to Biology and Environmental Biology. 

# Project Summary
We have developed an activity that at its core studies the Central Dogma and protein structure.

It compares structural and molecular differences between a Roundup resistant and a Roundup sensitive weed, using _Arabidopsis_ as our model organism.  The students will figure out which protein is affected, what the DNA and amino acid sequence difference is between the resistant and sensitive varieties, and what the protein differences look like.  Then the students will suggest an alternative herbicide that uses a different pathway to kill the resistand weed.  The following NCBI databases are used: PubMed, PubChem, nucleotide BLAST, protein-BLAST, and iCn3D.




# Curricular Package Details


## Learning Objectives
- Summarize the relationships between transcription, translation, and the universal genetic code 
- Utilize successfully NCBI and EXPASY databases and software, including: PubMed, PubChem, nucleotide BLAST, protein-BLAST, and iCn3D
  - Analyze DNA and protein sequence information  
  - Detect a mutation in an unknown sequence by comparing it to wild type sequence
- Predict how a specific DNA mutation can cause a phenotype change
- Understand the general mechanisms of action of herbicides in plants and their potential effects on humans
- Explore the role of selective pressures on evolution of organisms


## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).

## Assessments
The assessments for this will be the protein produced in iCn3D and open ended discussion questions.

## Future Work
There are many different directions you can add on to this activity. For example the effects on pollinators, GMOs such as Roundup ready crops, the ecology of roundup resistant weeds like milkweed, health consequences in humans, model organisms like _Arabidopsis_, effects in the soil micobiome.  

You could also look at other Herbicides like Paraquat, Antifungals like Manzate, Insecticides like DDT, or Endocrine Disruptors like Atrazine.
